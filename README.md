# AI-coach-with-MediaPipe
This is a Ai coach which can track your motion and count for you

In this project i used libraries like MediaPipe , Numpy , math , Opencv and used these tools to track motion of an specific part of body

In this level i gave the right arm position based on MediaPipe landmarks but you can give it more or even mutiple landmarks if you change the code a little :)

This AI coach will count reapets of any motion for right arm and show you a bar that shows the status of motion from 0 % to 100 % with colors

This is a prototype and i want to make it more advanced for more uses...

The level of files(from easy to advanced) :
1- PoseEstimation.py
2- PoseModule.py
3- PoseExample
4- PoseDetector(final)
